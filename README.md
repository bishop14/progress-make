# ProgressMake

ProgressMake is a script that wraps GNU make and writes its output in a fancy way.  
Use ProgressMake to run the GNU make tool and get the progress of the running build process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
**GNU make**: 3.81+  
**Python**: 3.4+

### Installing

You can just download the progressmake.py script and run it
```bash
./progressmake.py
# or
python3 progressmake.py
```
If you prefer a fast way to run ProgressMake, you can add it to your system path or create a symbolic link to it
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/progressmake
# or
ln -s /usr/bin/pmake /path/to/progressmake.py
```

## Compatibility
ProgressMake runs well on Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 16.04.
